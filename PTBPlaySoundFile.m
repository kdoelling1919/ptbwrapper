% File: PTBPlaySoundFile.m
%
% Plays a given .wav file
%
% Args:
%	- soundfile: The file to play
%       - E.g. 'Test.wav'
%       - NOTE: Only .wav files are playable so far
%	- duration: How long to show the the text. This should also be in a
%           cell, and can be any one or a mixture of a couple of options:
%       - 'end': This will play the sound file until it's over.
%       - Relative time (e.g. {.5}) will display for that amount of seconds
%       - Absolute time (e.g. {3.6517e+005}) will display until that system
%           time is reached. This number can come from either GetSecs or
%           PTBLastKeyPRessTime. Be warned, if you try to use this and the
%           calculation is not correct, your program will just hang.
%               NOTE: Any time greater than 1000 is assumed to be an
%               absolute time.
%       - Key press: (e.g. {'a'}) will wait until that key is pressed.
%           - Can also use {'any'} for any key.
%       - Sound trigger: {'sound'} will wait for a sound. The volume is
%           controlled by PTBSetSoundKeyLevel.
%       * NOTE: If you combine these, the display will wait until the first
%       is reach. So, {'any',2} will wait 2 seconds for any key to be
%       pressed.
%
% NOTE: For now, calling this on its own will not clear the previous
%   screen. To have a new screen shown at the same time, set this duration
%   to -1 and put the screen call with the duration afterwards.
%   * If you do the same with another file, it will play both at once.
%       - E.g. a chord out of single notes.
